                <ul>
                    <li>Jacques Webster was born on April 30, 1992 in Houston, Texas. He grew up in Missouri City, a middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston. Scott stayed with his grandmother "in the hood" from ages one to six, but later moved to the suburbs, where his mother worked for Apple Inc., while his father ran his own business. Scott attended the University of Texas at San Antonio before dropping out to fully pursue his music career.</li>

                    <li>At the age of 16, Scott embarked on his musical career as a record producer, with a focus on hip hop production.
